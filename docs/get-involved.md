# How to get involved with RCC

**Information interview:**

Set up a recorded, short information interview to briefly discuss your project, share insights on supercomputing, and highlight how Hyak has supported your work. There is a chance that a part of the interview will be featured on the homepage of Hyak website as a spotlight! If you are interested in this option, please send an email to [<ins>**help@uw.edu**</ins>](mailto:help@uw.edu) with "Hyak student interview" in the subject line.

**Office hours:**

As an experienced user, you can co-lead the data science office hour on HPC to provide specialized support to the community. In person office hours are held weekly. See the [<ins>**UW-IT Research Computing Calendar**</ins>](https://calendar.washington.edu/sea_uwit-rc) to find upcoming office hours. You can select "HPC Office Hours - In Person" or "Research Computing Club Office Hour - In person." Let us know if you plan to attend.

**Tutorial on Hyak documentation:**
