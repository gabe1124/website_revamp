# Hyak Access

## Applying for Access

1. Make sure you are eligible and have [<ins>**joined RCC**</ins>](index.md#joining-rcc).
2. Review the [<ins>**Hyak Prerequisites**</ins>](prerequisites.md). Hyak is used through a linux command line. For many researchers, HPC resources are the first time they encounter this. This is fine! But you should spend a bit of time making sure you grasp the basics before moving to the supercomputer.
3. Bookmark the [<ins>**Hyak Documentation**</ins>](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs). Further, you should consider attending [<ins>**office hours or a UWIT Research Computing training event Hyak training session**</ins>](https://calendar.washington.edu/sea_uwit-rc).
4. Read and agree to the RCC Hyak resource [<ins>**terms of service**</ins>](hyak_TOS.md).
5. [<ins>**Subscribe to the Hyak mailing list**</ins>](https://mailman1.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/hyak-users) for reminders about monthly maintenance and training opportunity announcements.
6. Complete the [<ins>**RCC Hyak skills assessment**</ins>](https://forms.office.com/r/h7Ecdpfh2z). Completion of this form serves as your application for access to Hyak and will trigger the review of all requirements. 
    * ***It may take up to 5 business days to grant access.*** If you have not heard back after 5 days, you may email [<ins>**hpcc@uw.edu**</ins>](hpcc@uw.edu).
